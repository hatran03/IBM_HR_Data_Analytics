## 1. Project Objective
The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive and insightful view of IBM's human resources data to support management and stakeholders in making strategic decisions regarding workforce management. Using Tableau, the project aims to create an interactive dashboard for analyzing various factors such as salary, age, years of service, the number of companies worked at, and gender ratio across departments and positions.

## 2. Key Components of the Project
Data Collection:

Data is collected from IBM's HR management system and other relevant sources. This data includes personal information (age, gender), job-related information (salary, position, department), and work history (years of experience, number of companies previously worked at).
Data Processing (ETL):

Extract: Extract data from various data sources.
Transform: Clean, standardize, and transform the data to fit the analysis requirements.
Load: Load the processed data into Tableau for visualization.
Dashboard Development:

Employee Overview: A dashboard providing an overview of the entire company's workforce, including the number of employees, gender distribution, average age, and average salary.
Department and Position Analysis: Detailed dashboards analyzing salary, years of experience, and the number of companies worked at by employees in different departments and positions.
Gender Ratio Analysis: Charts and scatter plots to track gender ratios across various departments and positions.
Results and Conclusions:

Insight 1: Analysis of salary by age and position reveals a relationship between experience and salary.

Insight 2: Gender ratio analysis in departments shows significant disparities in some areas.

Insight 3: The average years of experience in each department and how it affects salary levels.

## 3. Tools Used
Tableau: Used for data visualization and dashboard development.
SQL: Used for querying data from different sources.
Excel: Assisted in initial data processing.

## 4. Project Benefits
This project provides IBM's managers and HR department with a comprehensive and visual overview of the workforce structure. It aids in decision-making regarding hiring, training, and talent management, while also identifying potential issues and opportunities within the organization.
